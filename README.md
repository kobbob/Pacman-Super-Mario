# Pacman-Super-Mario

Re-Testing CSS and Vanilla Javascript as originally desired during bootcamp. 


## Game objectives: 

Based on the original 1980s Pac Man arcade game, the player (Pac-Man) aims to eat all of the dots within the maze, whilst avoiding four ghosts (who are trying to pursue Pac-Man). 

If Pac-Man consumes all the dots in the maze without getting caught, the player moves to the next level. 

However, if Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, the player loses a life. Once all three lives are lost, the game ends. 

Each ghost has their own unique artificial intelligence (A.I.), which determines their movement around the maze. Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man; Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him; and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.

In addition, there are four bonus "power pellets" in the maze that give Pac-Man extra points and the ability to hunt down the ghosts. The ghosts turn into flashing blue icons which indicate they are being hunted. 

As the player progresses through each level, the difficulty increases: the ghosts become faster, and the energizers' effect decreases in duration, eventually disappearing entirely.
